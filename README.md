## About Me

I'm a sometimes physicist, sometimes artist working out of the Chicago area. My focuses in science lie in the exploration of the universe through the detection of astrophysical particles. My interests in art revolve around teaching science, usually physics, in new and creative ways. I do this through creative coding projects, some of which are shown below.

## Physics

I am a part of the Beamforming Elevated Array for COsmic Neutrinos (BEACON) experiment and the Radio Neutrino Observatory - Greenland (RNO-G) experiment. These experiments are using novel techniques to detect radio-wave airshowers created by astrophysical neutrinos when they interact in the earth (specifically in the earth's crust or glacial ice). I am currently developing the next-generation all-Terrain Data AcQuisition system (TerraDAQ) for the BEACON experiment. My code developed for BEACON can be found here[BEACON code](../beaconzach). I am also preparing to travel to Summit Station [Summit Website](https://geo-summit.org/) this summer for the next deployment season for RNO-G.

## Art

My artistic pieces have focused on teaching science, primarily physics, through creative coding and innovative ideas. I believe anyone can learn science, and taht

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/zcurtisginsberg/zcurtisginsberg.github.io/settings/pages). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
